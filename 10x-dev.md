Intro
0:09
modern acceptance
0:24
um so i have 48 minutes to talk to you about this subject
0:30
uh i'm gonna i'm gonna talk about subject as you'll see there's a lot of personal
0:35
views in it uh i'm gonna take you through what a 10x might do and then i'm going
0:43
to do it again and i'm going to show you a few of the tools that
0:49
are rather the tools concepts rather than specific tools that you might be interested in looking at
0:55
this subject is quite fluffy because it's all about how we behave and
1:01
what we think and of course as developers we're all used to be saying i am an edge case
1:08
nobody else does what i do i am the only one who does it right so actually that's not true we all
1:15
have commonalities and i'm going to talk a little bit about what the they are from a 10x point of view so let's start
1:24
what is a 10x developer you know well you've all read the press do you know you can hire 10x developers
What is a 10x developer
1:30
you can go to google and type in 10x developer and you'll get adverts saying you can hire them
1:37
ready immediately not sure what they are so do we imagine this
1:44
that a 10x developer is a super person who could just do things better
1:50
superpowers that's what it sounds like you know can write 10 times more lighter codes
1:57
than you can fix 10 times more bugs than you
2:04
has a secret identity you know those guys who say you know i only work alone don't hold me back
2:11
i've got i need more coffee those people is it them
2:18
and do they have special powers real special powers i rewrote the back end overnight
2:23
yeah how well did that go but we know these people right you've met them you've worked with them there's
2:30
always somebody who's very visible in reality what you'll find is that 10x
2:36
developers as we start to describe that that's not really true they're much more
2:42
humble and they're much more invisible they certainly don't spend their time
2:49
you know they don't spend eight hours a week 800 hours a week not even sure that's possible but you get the idea do
2:55
they just work 10 times harder than you no right but we can describe them this way all right
3:02
they're the people you know who just seem to get stuff done
3:08
high quality deliveries on time just better
3:13
right but actually the last line there is the key
3:18
is actually they aren't just doing themselves and making their life better and giving
3:25
you know earning more money that way they're helping you as the team get better
3:31
and a lot of the people that you work with don't do that because they go hey i am the best person
3:38
so a 10x developer is more like the guy the duke on the jet set you know
3:46
more thinking about the future more less adversarial
3:53
more iron man than superman right superman is not the greatest model is it
3:59
you know secret identity you know you don't want people's secret
4:04
identities iron man is a much better model for us to mark think about because apart from the fact that in the
4:12
iron man that we know there was a lot of brains involved a lot of smarts
4:17
it's still tech it's still application of tech and if you squint at it you can say that
4:23
iron man is a 10x developer because they get things done and it all works
4:29
together much better than a superman model but actually as i said it's even more
4:34
than that it isn't about somebody who gets stuff done
4:40
it's about how well they help others achieve success how well they help the team
4:46
yes they're good and they're really fantastic but the best ones are the ones that bring the whole team
4:52
up right and i'll we'll talk about in a minute so i'm going to claim 10x
4:57
developer is someone like this who's efficient they just do the right thing
5:02
they're effective they just do the right thing they enable others to do the right thing
5:09
right they communicate they communicate very well whether it's up down across
5:16
because they understand that it's everybody else together that makes us
5:21
successful and of course it's productive because you can do just the right thing
5:28
but it still has to be connected with everything else and a master craftsman
5:34
actually careful when you say craftsman we talk about developers but i'm talking about people who
5:39
understand the tools that they use you know whatever it is that they want to use whatever process
5:46
they understand it what a 10x developer is somebody who very often would have what you might
5:52
call second thoughts somebody who looks at something gets the obvious feedback and and
5:59
reaction that maybe you do but a second second thoughts are going hang on a
6:05
minute let's just step back let's think about that again let's think about it differently and some of the stuff i'm
6:10
going to show you just how those sort of things sometimes pan out right so it sounds like this person is
6:17
fantastic right um but of course we're talking about it as if they don't really exist and
6:24
i to a degree i suspect they don't really exist they're just a role model that we like
6:30
because we're all under pressure to deliver and so anything we can do to be more productive
6:37
is attractive right so go search for 10x developer and apart from the fact that you'll find people who say you can hire
6:44
them from them uh mostly it's like what is a 10x developer right
6:50
so okay so who are me what am i so my name is steve poole i used to work
6:56
for ibm work for red hat i now work for sonotype i do security stuff supply chain stuff
7:03
but i care about developers i care about developer productivity i've done a lot of stuff
7:09
right i've been doing it for a long time
7:14
look i started out when java was tiny right that's when i got into the
Steves career
7:19
business and it's all been java space i've worked with some really amazing people i've worked with
7:25
lots of guys at sun the vm team did talks with stewart marks you know
7:30
fabulous people i've done amazing things with other people
7:36
open jdk work java work you name it like everybody else i've done my own
7:42
stuff i did i had the i had the honor of doing the first
7:48
128-bit java 128-bit because es400s are 128-bit right
7:55
that was what i was asked to do and so i that was my job and i did that that was cool learnt stuff
8:01
and then go on to run bigger things you know to be team leaders and then i end up
8:07
doing really big serious work leading big teams
8:12
lots of money enormous scale okay and a bunch of stuff on the side
8:19
so yeah that's fun i've had a great career i've done a little amazing amount of stuff and i've worked with some amazing people
8:26
but i'll tell you what the number of people i've met who i would say are 10x developers
8:33
my new number one a year maybe if you're lucky and that's working on some really serious
8:39
projects with lots of people right not all of them were developers some of
8:44
the best 10x developers that i've worked with have been
8:50
testers because they helped make the change they helped make things happen it isn't just
8:55
about developers and of course not only were superheroes they were just very well focused human
9:02
beings they had a job to do and they knew how to do it and they knew how to enable everybody else
9:08
right so how do you think like a 10x developer
Role models
9:17
well we don't talk about tech i'm going to give you two role models it's just a little tiny thing
9:24
one side jeremy wade a most amazing fisherman you may have seen him on tv and
9:29
this lady whose name i work mangle okay so jeremy is a great fisherman
9:37
but if you've ever watched how he fishes because he's on tv you can watch these things
9:43
he has a particular style of doing it and it's entertaining but he does
9:49
the right thing first he doesn't he's out trying to find catch fish all around the world unusual fish dangerous fish
9:55
you name it and the first thing he does is he understands the environment he puts time
10:01
and effort into thinking about what he's trying to achieve and he talks to the locals he talks to
10:08
his teammates gets experience from them understands what it is that they're trying to do okay so i know
10:14
how to catch this fish and it does like this and it lives here and it eats this that's the very first thing that they do
10:21
they don't touch tech they think about the problem they understand they explore they learn
10:28
that's the very first thing and that's what 10x developers do if you
10:33
look at the people who are productive they're all about removing uncertainty
10:39
so they'll go learn about the environment they'll go kick the apis they'll look at the tools that are being
10:45
provided they won't touch anything about what you're trying to do
10:50
what's my problem well before i get to my problem i want to look at the environment and understand it
10:57
because with understanding comes certainty because with uncertainty everything
11:04
starts to go wrong now our other role model
11:09
is olympic world european champion in long jump but you know about athletes if you
11:15
watch them there is this moment in all athletes like that
11:21
where they're getting ready to go and then they focus and they will have different tricks but they focus
11:27
and they're not distracted and they're going that's just the one thing i'm going to do
11:35
and that's what 10x developers are like if you talk to them they're not doing 20 things they're not
11:40
doing 50 things they're doing one thing and they're very clear about why that next thing is the next thing to do
11:47
they have that clarity of thought because they understand what they're trying to
11:53
achieve they understand why this thing is the next thing to do and not this not this thing
11:58
right the things that we're talking about to a degree are what we normally talk about but they have much better
12:04
understanding of how to prioritize because they spend time gathering facts and data and exploring
12:12
things to be certain that this is a useful type effort to spend
12:17
right so it's good to have these role models and it's good for these role models not to be in the tech space because i said
12:23
we tend to claim that we're all unique so it's good to look for those and
12:30
i'm not i have my role models that i can point to over the years but that doesn't really help you
12:36
you need to find your own model your own models you have to find the people within your organization that just are exhibiting the skills that you like
12:42
and the behavior and you just go talk to them because almost always they're there and they'll go yeah i'll
12:47
talk to you i'll help you i tell you how how it works for me right because it is all about the team
12:54
uh you can be a better developer for sure but at the end of the day if you're part
13:00
of a better team then everybody benefits okay so what do they do
Productivity
13:07
productivity how to behave like a 10x developer well there are some truisms you know pithy
13:15
statements so it's not how you write code doesn't matter where the brackets are
13:22
what the names of functions are methods that doesn't matter but it is really important about the code that you
13:28
write that it's just the code you need to do the job you don't think about the future
13:35
you're right you think about just the job the code you have to do now just whatever it is you're being asked
13:40
to do the minimum right because we'll come on to why that is in a minute okay
13:46
and it's not about any individual tool that you use but it is about that you use the tools that you've got
13:53
and you use them wisely and knowledgeably again i'll talk a bit later on about why
13:59
this can go seriously wrong if you don't pay attention to your tools right and as i claim it's about the team and
14:05
not about the individual because you don't get to the top of everest on your own you have people to
14:11
help you get there and if they don't know what you're trying to do and can't fit in with what
14:16
you're trying to achieve it's not going to work right and it's not about guesswork it is
14:22
amazing how often we start projects not understanding what we're trying to achieve and what how it's going to bite
14:29
us it could be performance profiles it could be cost you name it we've all gone there and
14:35
gone oh that didn't work i wish i'd known that earlier so productivity from a tedx developer's
14:41
point of view is certainty how do i make sure now that i have the facts i need to do that job
14:48
it's much better to take time out to do that than it is to go oh we'll fix it when we get there it'll be fine
14:55
yeah so it's about that it's about getting information to the
15:01
developer feedback we're going to talk about feedback about educating the developer
15:07
with the necessary information to do the job and getting it as early as possible
15:12
because you know how it works if it if you've written a whole bunch of stuff and you're six months into development
15:18
and then something horrible surfaces that you could have fixed easily if
15:23
you'd known you kick yourself so 10x developers try to predict what that's going to be
15:30
and of course it's different in every situation and bring it back to the beginning how can i prove to myself that
15:36
i understand what i'm going to be doing right go away
15:42
so you can see the others ensuring developers spend their time on creating value yes we're all really busy
15:48
we don't want to do stuff that's if that's wasted and whatever that is whether that's
15:54
communicating with people whether it's writing code or tests or or whatever
15:59
anything that gets in the way of delivering value needs to be
16:04
examined reduced removed right everything that gets in the way
16:11
between you writing code and it becoming value is
16:17
reduces your productivity and tedx developers look at that in all manners
16:24
to try and figure out how to make you productive so they might work like this right this is
16:31
just made-up example because it's silly but i want you to get the sort of the
16:36
sense of this stuff right so the first thing you'll notice is 10x
16:42
developers have really liked this tool and what they really like doing is putting everything can get i know 10x
16:49
developers who basically their whole life all their notes and things not even code
16:55
everything they're doing goes into github so it goes into git and if they commit it because they make a mistake
17:01
they can roll it back and they get into the habit everything i do goes in here why did i make the
17:06
change i've done that i've changed the config that goes in there i've written some code that goes
17:11
in there i've made a note to buy some milk that goes in there because it's a habit it's a safety valve i can go back and
17:18
find things they do that a lot right and then the second thing that you see
17:23
them do is sort of go to the other end and go okay
17:28
what am i going to deliver how am i going to deliver so quite often i've seen these guys build
17:34
small ci cd systems for their own purposes they're not ready to it's not one they're going to share
17:40
but they want to be able to get that regular process going because you don't want unpleasant
17:46
surprises when you try to go to production so anything you can do to help you and of course
17:51
uh it's a lot easier if you go you know you commit stuff and then kick a jenkins build job off to do all the stuff that
17:57
you're gonna do you're going to do it anyway so put into jenkins right but just enough
18:05
then if you challenge them with something new they tend to
18:11
wander around it's like they learn things so things you might learn so somebody gives
18:18
you a new platform to go do something with what might they learn first well they'll probably learn what's the editor
18:24
because that's the first thing to do is learn the editor because you can't you don't know how you've got no ability to
18:30
install stuff also maybe you install it learn how to install stuff right
18:36
and the objective here is to learn just enough to be able to do
18:42
the next step and so it's how does delivery work okay i've got a new platform whether it's
18:48
serverless or a vm or something brand new i have some code i need to get it in
18:53
this place let's prove i know how that works because that's going to pay dividends
18:58
because that's going to educate me on some of the peculiarities and i need to know things like editors
19:05
and things because when things go wrong on my machine on my serverless stuff wherever it is i may not have intellij
19:12
available to me i may you know so i need to use the simplest basic tools available that's how they think
19:18
simplest things to get the job done right and then once they've proven that the
19:23
thing works and they've got hello world or whatever the stuff is they break it
19:28
because the next thing you need to know is how to find out that things have gone
19:33
wrong and where the debug is and where the logs are and where the journals are and what it looks like when it goes
19:39
wrong right do i have to write special code to get some diagnostic information out oh i
19:45
didn't realize that that happens at this beginning stage
19:53
and then if it's an api for instance they start taking it apart
20:01
we're talking about people who as i said well a craftsman and i said i
20:06
don't you have to be careful with the term craftsman but you get the idea that somebody who knows the tools well becomes a habit so if you have an api
20:14
what are they going to do they're going to go read about it they can learn what their limitations are they're going to look
20:19
for the places in the documentation that says this might bite you or it might not be that explicit they read the fine print
20:26
do you know that you get rate limited after this those sort of information is what they
20:32
need to they're going to pull out and then they're going to try them they're going to kick the tires they're going to write code
20:40
they're going to write code to test the api does what it says it does and you'll see that across the board not
20:46
just in remote apis on other services but also on um functions if i get a new if i take in
20:54
a new component and it's got five things it does i'm gonna write five test cases to prove
20:59
it actually does what it does because one day it's going to stop doing that and i'll have a test case to catch it
21:06
and if that catching that will make me super productive rather than spending hours and hours trying to debug
21:11
something which is because something that i use change behavior right
21:17
and document everything is make sure that you've got a record so that when you come back
21:23
you can read your notes and you put your notes in github okay
21:29
more then you start building something whatever it is that's important
21:35
you're gonna prototype it now this doesn't have to be right at the beginning this is all the way through
21:40
you're gonna write codes and tests but right now is the thing to say is the
21:47
code's not important right code is not important in this it is
21:52
sort of important but it's not really important the tests are the most important because the tests
21:59
so the jelly mold model is imagine the jelly is the code
22:04
the mold are your tests because
22:11
yeah that that gives you an a a mapping of your code the behavior you're going
22:16
to change your code because you'll learn things about the product about what you're doing and it's involved the test cases that mold gives
22:26
will give you confidence later on to do some serious refactoring because
22:31
you have this enormous safety net all right and if i say if there's any safe any superpower that i've seen
22:38
come out of these guys is that they write test cases to test the functionality of what th
